This service provides JWT token generation and verification.

To run this service locally:
1. login to mysql as user 'root', create database user in mysql
mysql -u root -p
password should be 'admin' if you didn't set it up, google if you can't find correct password
then run creation database command:
create database user;
create database profile;
create database provider_profile;
2. create user to access the new database, this user is from settings.py in this project
in mysql client, create the user along with password, user and password should match settings.py
i.e.:
grant all privileges on user.* to 'oneseek'@'localhost' identified by "jobpost8531162";
grant all privileges on profile.* to 'oneseek'@'localhost' identified by "jobpost8531162";
grant all privileges on provider_profile.* to 'oneseek'@'localhost' identified by "jobpost8531162";


To test obtaining a JWT token and verifying one:
1. start this service
2. create a user if no user exists, to create user using REST from browserï¼š
    http://127.0.0.1:8013/user/
3. login using password and user name of user:
    http://127.0.0.1:8013/login/
4. verify token generated by previous step.
    http://127.0.0.1:8013/verify/
This verification step will be used by other services
when any request from user needs authentication.  Requset should contain JWT token which will be
send as a POST request to this REST endpoint and biz logic should only proceed if this endpoint
returns status "200 OK", this endpoint essentially servs as a gatekeeper for all requests
needing authentication.
