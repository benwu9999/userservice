This service provides JWT token generation and verification.

To run this service locally:
1. create database user in mysql
create database user;
2. create user to access the new database, this user is from settings.py in this project
in mysql client, create the user along with password, user and password should match settings.py
i.e.:
grant all privileges on user.* to 'oneseek'@'localhost' identified by "jobpost8531162";


To test obtaining a JWT token and verifying one:
1. start this service
2. create a user if no user exists, to create user using REST from browserï¼š
    http://127.0.0.1:8013/user/
3. login using password and user name of user:
    http://127.0.0.1:8013/login/
4. verify token generated by previous step.
    http://127.0.0.1:8013/verify/
This verification step will be used by other services
when any request from user needs authentication.  Requset should contain JWT token which will be
send as a POST request to this REST endpoint and biz logic should only proceed if this endpoint
returns status "200 OK", this endpoint essentially servs as a gatekeeper for all requests
needing authentication.
